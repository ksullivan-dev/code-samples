This sample creates a Google Map with several events at different locations. It allows you to filter by date as well as type of event.  Additionally, if there are multiple events within a 1.5 mile radius of each other, the events will be listed on the same map marker to help de-clutter the map.  All events within the filtered range will be shown in the sidebar.  Finally, ads/sponsor logos can be mixed in to the sidebar wtih a ratio of 3 events to 1 ad.
